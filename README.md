# OpenAPI Spec

This project is my first attempt at creating an OpenAPI specification. The goal is to define and document an API using the OpenAPI 3.0 format, allowing for easy sharing and understanding of the API's structure.

## What is the OpenAPI Spec?

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) is a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code, additional documentation, or network traffic inspection. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with minimal implementation logic.

## Features

- **User API**:
  - Retrieve a list of users.
  - Optional filtering of users by name using query parameters.
- Defined components and schemas for reusable and structured API definitions.

## Getting Started
